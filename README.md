# Fantasy Footy by Gareth Dooling

# Brief

- To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.
- To utilise containers to host and deploy the application.
- To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy the application.

The final deliverable for the project is as follows:

1. A GitHub repository containing all of the code written for this project, including the software source code, Jenkins configuration, Docker configuration and any related scripts.
2. The GitHub repository should also contain the write-up for the project in the form of a README.md file.
3. Also required is video evidence of the application and CI/CD pipeline working.

## Part 1: Project Summary

I proposed to create a simple fantasy football application relating to two tables; 'Teams' and 'Players'. The app should demonstrate CRUD functionality so a user will be able to create, read, update and delete teams and players. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to add the second 'Players' table so the app only demonstrates CRUD for the 'Teams' table.
