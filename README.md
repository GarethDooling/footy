# Fantasy Footy - QA DevOps Boot Camp Final Project 

# Brief

- To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.
- To utilise containers to host and deploy the application.
- To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy the application.

The final deliverables for the project are:

1. A GitHub repository containing all of the code written for this project, including the software source code, Jenkins configuration, Docker configuration and any related scripts.
2. The GitHub repository should also contain the write-up for the project in the form of a README.md file.
3. Also required is video evidence of the application and CI/CD pipeline working.

## Part 1: Project Design

According to the MoSCoW principles, I proposed to create a simple fantasy football application relating to two tables; 'Teams' and 'Players'. The app MUST demonstrate CRUD functionality so a user is be able to create, read, update and delete teams and players. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to add the second 'Players' table so the app only demonstrates CRUD for the 'Teams' table. 

As a result, I was not able to add any further SHOULD/COULD/WOULD elements to the project. 

## Part 2: Architecture

### 2.1 Entity Diagrams

The initial plan was for a one to many relationship between the databases however, unfortunately, I was not able to link the two databases together.

### 2.2 CI/CD Pipeline

The diagram below shows how the CI/CD pipeline should operate however I was not able to proceed past the build stage.
